## Hi there 👋

# 🐍 My Python Learning Adventure

*Because life's too short for boring, repetitive tasks*

---

## What am I about?

This is my personal collection of Python projects and coursework as I stumble through the wonderful world of programming. Currently juggling multiple learning paths because apparently I like making things complicated for myself. 

This isn't a polished portfolio. There's messy commits and half-finished projects.

## 📁 What's Inside

**📂 Automate the Boring Stuff**  
*Keywords: automation, scripting, productivity*  
Following along with Al Sweigart's excellent book by recommendation of my brother-in-law.

**📂 Data Science Foundations (Codecademy)**  
*Keywords: pandas, analysis, visualization*  
Diving into the data science world because data is important (and I want to know what it's saying).

**📂 Codecademy Challenge Projects**  
*Keywords: practice, challenges, skill-building*  
Where I test my skills and occasionally question my life choices.

**📂 Al Seigwart Python Projects**  
*Keywords: advanced concepts, real-world applications*  
Taking on more complex projects.

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

I want to **challenge myself**, **make more $$$**, and **follow my interests** in GIS software development and data science/engineering.

Programming can be confusing and discouraging sometimes. But when a script finally works the way you intended? That feeling is pure achievement.

## 🛠️ My Setup

- **Python 3** running in **Anaconda** 
- **IDEs I'm experimenting with:** Jupyter Notebooks, Mu Editor, VS Code, and Spyder
- **Background:** Currently using Python with ArcGIS/ArcPy and ArcGIS Online API for GIS work

## 📚 Learning Resources

- [**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - Free online version (seriously, Al Sweigart is a legend)
- **Codecademy Data Science Foundations** - My structured learning path for data science fundamentals

## 🎲 Future Plans

- Maybe add a "Lessons Learned" section when I've learned enough lessons worth sharing
- Build some schweet tools
- Eventually use some of this for code reviews to practice formal evaluations

*Happy coding! 🚀*
